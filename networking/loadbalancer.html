    <p>

    <ul>
        <li>An Application Load Balancer periodically sends requests to its registered targets to test their status.
            These tests are called health checks.

        </li>
        <li>

            Each load balancer node routes requests only to the healthy targets in the enabled Availability Zones for
            the load balancer. Each load balancer node checks the health of each target, using the health check settings
            for the target groups with which the target is registered. If a target group contains only unhealthy
            registered targets, the load balancer nodes route requests across its unhealthy targets.

        </li>
        <li> <b> You must ensure that your load balancer can communicate with registered targets on both the listener
                port
                and the health check port. </b> Whenever you add a listener to your load balancer or update the health
            check port
            for a target group used by the load balancer to route requests, you must verify that the security groups
            associated with the load balancer allow traffic on the new port in both directions.

    <p>It provides content-based routing and support for container-based applications.</p>
    <p class="heading">Application Load Balancer can route a request to a service based on the content of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
    <p class="heading"> Host-based Routing: </p>
    You can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing you to route to multiple
    domains from the same load balancer.
    <p class="heading"> Path-based Routing: </p>
    You can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header.
    HTTP header-based routing:
    You can route a client request based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header.
    HTTP method-based routing:
    You can route a client request based on any standard or custom HTTP method.
    Query string parameter-based routing:
    You can route a client request based on the query string or query parameters.
    Source IP address CIDR-based routing:
    You can route a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates.
    Path-based Routing Overview:
    You can use path conditions to define rules that route requests based on the URL in the request (also known as
    path-based routing).
    The path pattern is applied only to the path of the URL, not to its query </p>
    <p class="main-heading">Network Load Balancer</p>

    <p>Functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can
        handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a
        target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target
        on the port specified in the listener configuration. </p>
    <p class="heading">Request Routing and IP Addresses</p>

    <p>- If you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP
        address
        specified in the primary network interface for the instance. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP
        address from the data packet before forwarding it to the target instance.

        If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an instance using any private IP address
        from one or more network interfaces. This enables multiple applications on an instance to use the same port.
        Note that each network interface can have its security group. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP
        address before forwarding it to the target.</p>

        Application Load Balancer + dynamic port mapping
        Application Load Balancer can automatically distribute incoming application traffic across multiple targets,
        such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of
        your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Dynamic port
        mapping with an Application Load Balancer makes it easier to run multiple tasks on the same Amazon ECS service
        on an Amazon ECS cluster.
    </p>

    <p>
        Network Load Balancer + dynamic port mapping - Network Load Balancer is best suited for use-cases involving low
        latency and high throughput workloads that involve scaling to millions of requests per second. Network Load
        Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets - Amazon EC2 instances,
        microservices, and containers – within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) based on IP protocol data.
