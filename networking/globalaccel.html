    <p class="main-heading">AWS Global Accelerator</p>

    <p>
        Service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It
        provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or
        multiple AWS Regions, such as your <b> Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances</b>.
    </p>

    <p><b>
            Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT(MQTT), or Voice over IP,
            as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional
            failover.</b>
