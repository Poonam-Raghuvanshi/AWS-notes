    <p class="main-heading"> Virtual Private Cloud </p>
    <p class="heading"> VPC Reachability Analyzer </p>
    <p> Configuration analysis tool that enables you to perform connectivity testing between a source resource and a
        destination resource in your virtual private clouds (VPCs). When the destination is reachable, Reachability
        Analyzer produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path between the source and the destination. When
        the destination is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer identifies the blocking component. </p>
    <p> For example, paths can be blocked by configuration
        issues in a security group, network ACL, route table, or load balancer.</p>
    <p class="heading"> NAT instance </p>
    <p>A NAT instance or a NAT Gateway can be used in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private
        subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet.</p>
    <p>NAT instance can be used as a bastion server

        Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance

        NAT instance supports port forwarding</p>
    <p class="heading"> VPC endpoints </p>
    <p>AWS customers can access Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon
        VPC) using VPC endpoints, without using public IPs, and without needing to traverse the public internet. VPC
        endpoints for Amazon SQS are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a highly available, scalable technology that enables
        you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services.

        Amazon VPC endpoints are easy to configure. They also provide reliable connectivity to Amazon SQS without
        requiring an internet gateway, Network Address Translation (NAT) instance, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect
        connection. With VPC endpoints, the data between your Amazon VPC and Amazon SQS queue is transferred within the
        Amazon network, helping protect your instances from internet traffic.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> AWS PrivateLink </p>
    <p>

        AWS PrivateLink simplifies the security of data shared with cloud-based applications by eliminating the exposure
        of data to the public Internet. AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and
        on-premises applications, securely on the Amazon network. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services
        across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify the network architecture.</p>

    <p class="heading"> Transit gateway </p>
    <p>A transit gateway is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs)
        and on-premises networks. As your cloud infrastructure expands globally, inter-Region peering connects transit
        gateways together using the AWS Global Infrastructure. <b>Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels
            over the public internet</b>.</p>
    <p class="heading"> VPC Flow Logs </p>
    <p>A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Internet Gateway </p>
    <p>Horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly
        available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your <b>VPC and the internet</b> . It,
        therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic. </p>
    <p class="heading"> AWS Site-to-Site VPN </p>
    <p>
        Enables you to securely connect your <b> on-premises network site to your Amazon VPC </b>. A VPC VPN Connection
        utilizes IPSec to establish encrypted network connectivity between your intranet and Amazon VPC over the
        Internet. VPN Connections can be configured in minutes and are a good solution if you have an immediate need,
        have low to modest bandwidth requirements, and can tolerate the inherent variability in Internet-based
        connectivity. </p>
    <p class="heading"> Network Address Translation (NAT) instance</p>
    <p>
        You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in
        the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the
        instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet. Amazon provides Amazon Linux AMIs
        that are configured to run as NAT instances. These AMIs include the string amzn-ami-vpc-nat in their names, so
        you can search for them in the Amazon EC2 console. This option is ruled out because NAT instances are used to
        provide internet access to any instances in a private subnet.</p>
