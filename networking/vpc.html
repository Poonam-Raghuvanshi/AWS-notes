    <p class="heading"> VPC Reachability Analyzer </p>
    <p> Configuration analysis tool that enables you to perform connectivity testing between a source resource and a
        destination resource in your virtual private clouds (VPCs). When the destination is reachable, Reachability
        Analyzer produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path between the source and the destination. When
        the destination is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer identifies the blocking component. </p>
    <p> For example, paths can be blocked by configuration
        issues in a security group, network ACL, route table, or load balancer.</p>
    <p class="heading"> NAT instance </p>
    <p>A NAT instance or a NAT Gateway can be used in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private
        subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet.</p>
    <p>NAT instance can be used as a bastion server

        Security Groups can be associated with a NAT instance

        NAT instance supports port forwarding</p>
