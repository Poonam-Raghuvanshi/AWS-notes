    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Route 53</p>
    <p>
        Highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to
        perform three main functions in any combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> Choosing a routing policy</p>
    <p>
        When you create a record, you choose a routing policy, which determines how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries:

        Simple routing policy – Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a
        web server that serves content for the example.com website. You can use simple routing to create records in a
        private hosted zone.

        Failover routing policy – Use when you want to configure active-passive failover. You can use failover routing
        to create records in a private hosted zone.

        Geolocation routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users. You can use
        geolocation routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

        Geoproximity routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and,
        optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.

        Latency routing policy – Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to
        the region that provides the best latency. You can use latency routing to create records in a private hosted
        zone.

        IP-based routing policy – Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users, and have the
        IP addresses that the traffic originates from.

        Multivalue answer routing policy – Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy
        records selected at random. You can use multivalue answer routing to create records in a private hosted zone.

        Weighted routing policy – Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify. You can
        use weighted routing to create records in a private hosted zone.</p>

        <p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>

        <p>Amazon Route 53 uses control planes to perform management-related activities such as creating, updating, and
            deleting resources.</p>

        <p>The Data plane is used for performing core services of Amazon Route 53 such as authoritative DNS service,
            health checks, and responding to DNS queries in an Amazon VPC.</p>

        <p>The Data plane is globally distributed, offering 100% availability SLA. Control plane traffic is optimized
            for data consistency and may be impacted during disruptive events in the infrastructure.</p>

        <p>While configuring failover between multiple sites, data plane functions such as health checks should be
            preferred instead of control plane functions. In the above case, multiple endpoints in different regions can
            be associated with Route 53. Route 53 can be configured to failover to a healthy endpoint based upon the
            health checks which is a data plane function and always available.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A is incorrect </strong>as updating weights in a weighted routing policy is a control
                plane function. For additional resiliency during a disaster, use data plane functions instead of control
                plane functions.</li>
            <li><strong>Options B and C are incorrect </strong>as creating, updating, and deleting private or public
                hosted zone records are part of control plane actions. In case of a disaster, control planes might get
                affected. Data plane functions such as health checks should be used for resources that are always
                available.</li>
        </ul>

        Route 53 automatically routes the traffic to the new ELB IP addresses. With alias records, users do not need to
        change the record sets even if they have some configuration changes.
