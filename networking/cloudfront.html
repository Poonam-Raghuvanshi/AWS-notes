    <p class="main-heading">CloudFront</p>
    <p>Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos,
        applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a
        developer-friendly environment.

        <b>CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to
            your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your
            viewers,
            even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that
            content.</b>
        Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that tends to become less popular over
        time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video, photos, or artwork; e-commerce assets such as
        product photos and videos; and news and event-related content that might suddenly find new popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video
            streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can
            be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location.
        If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast
        (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin
        – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content.


    </p>
    <p>If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content, you can use the CloudFront geo
        restriction feature to do one of the following: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one
        of the countries on a whitelist of approved countries. Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're
        in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries. </p>
        
    <p> CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests.</p>
