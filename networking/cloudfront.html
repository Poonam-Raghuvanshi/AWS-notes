        <b> Content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video
            streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can
            be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location.
        If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast
        (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin
        – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content.
