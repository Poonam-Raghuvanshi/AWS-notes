    <p class="main-heading">CloudFront</p>
    <p>Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos,
        applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a
        developer-friendly environment.

        <b>CloudFront points of presence (POPs) (edge locations) make sure that popular content can be served quickly to
            your viewers. CloudFront also has regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your
            viewers,
            even when the content is not popular enough to stay at a POP, to help improve performance for that
            content.</b>
        Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that tends to become less popular over
        time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video, photos, or artwork; e-commerce assets such as
        product photos and videos; and news and event-related content that might suddenly find new popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video
            streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of CloudFront can
            be more cost-effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user requests content that you serve with CloudFront, their request is routed to a nearby Edge Location.
        If CloudFront has a cached copy of the requested file, CloudFront delivers it to the user, providing a fast
        (low-latency) response. If the file they’ve requested isn’t yet cached, CloudFront retrieves it from your origin
        – for example, the S3 bucket where you’ve stored your content.


    </p>
    <p>If you need to prevent users in specific countries from accessing your content, you can use the CloudFront geo
        restriction feature to do one of the following: Allow your users to access your content only if they're in one
        of the countries on a whitelist of approved countries. Prevent your users from accessing your content if they're
        in one of the countries on a blacklist of banned countries. </p>

    <p> CloudFront supports HTTP/RTMP protocol based requests.</p>
    <p class="heading">How you configure CloudFront to deliver your content</p>
    <p>
        You specify origin servers, like an Amazon S3 bucket or your own HTTP server, from which CloudFront gets your
        files which will then be distributed from CloudFront edge locations all over the world.

        An origin server stores the original, definitive version of your objects. If you're serving content over HTTP,
        your origin server is either an Amazon S3 bucket or an HTTP server, such as a web server. Your HTTP server can
        run on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance or on a server that you manage; these servers are
        also known as custom origins.

        You upload your files to your origin servers. Your files, also known as objects, typically include web pages,
        images, and media files, but can be anything that can be served over HTTP.

        If you're using an Amazon S3 bucket as an origin server, you can make the objects in your bucket publicly
        readable, so that anyone who knows the CloudFront URLs for your objects can access them. You also have the
        option of keeping objects private and controlling who accesses them. See Serving private content with signed
        URLs and signed cookies.

        You create a CloudFront distribution, which tells CloudFront which origin servers to get your files from when
        users request the files through your web site or application. At the same time, you specify details such as
        whether you want CloudFront to log all requests and whether you want the distribution to be enabled as soon as
        it's created.

        CloudFront assigns a domain name to your new distribution that you can see in the CloudFront console, or that is
        returned in the response to a programmatic request, for example, an API request. If you like, you can add an
        alternate domain name to use instead.

        CloudFront sends your distribution's configuration (but not your content) to all of its edge locations or points
        of presence (POPs)— collections of servers in geographically-dispersed data centers where CloudFront caches
        copies of your files.</p>
    <p>Geo Restriction feature of CloudFront helps in restricting traffic based on the user's geographic location.</p>
    <p>Correct options:
        Use CloudFront signed URLs
        Many companies that distribute content over the internet want to restrict access to documents, business data,
        media streams, or content that is intended for selected users, for example, users who have paid a fee.
        To securely serve this private content by using CloudFront, you can do the following:
        Require that your users access your private content by using special CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies.
        A signed URL includes additional information, for example, expiration date and time, that gives you more control
        over access to your content. So this is a correct option.
        Use CloudFront signed cookies
        CloudFront signed cookies allow you to control who can access your content when you don't want to change your
        current URLs or when you want to provide access to multiple restricted files, for example, all of the files in
        the subscribers' area of a website. So this is also a correct option.
    </p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>Option C is incorrect. </strong>The question mentions serving digital content to the end-users.
            There is no mention of private content, so it is not suitable to choose this option. But if someone
            wants&nbsp;to serve private content through CloudFront, they can choose&nbsp;signed URLs or signed cookies.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>A custom origin can point to an on-premises server and CloudFront is able to cache content for dynamic websites.
        CloudFront can provide performance optimizations for custom origins even if they are running on on-premises
        servers. These include persistent TCP connections to the origin, SSL enhancements such as Session tickets and
        OCSP stapling.

        Additionally, connections are routed from the nearest Edge Location to the user across the AWS global network.
        If the on-premises server is connected via a Direct Connect (DX) link this can further improve performance.</p>
