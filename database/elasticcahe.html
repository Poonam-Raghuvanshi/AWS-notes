        complexity associated with deploying and managing a distributed cache environment. </p>
    <p>Amazon ElastiCache is a popular choice for real-time use cases like Caching, Session Stores, Gaming, Geospatial
        Services, Real-Time Analytics, and Queuing. Elasticache is used as a caching layer in front of relational
        databases.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Elasticache Redis</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blazing fast in-memory data store that provides <b>sub-millisecond latency and multi-threaded
                architecture</b> to
            power internet-scale real-time applications. </li>
        <li>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a great choice for real-time
            transactional and analytical processing use cases such as caching,
            chat/messaging, gaming leaderboards, geospatial, machine learning,
            media streaming, queues, real-time analytics, and session store. </li>
