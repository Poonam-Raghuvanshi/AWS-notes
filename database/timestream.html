        <p>Amazon Timestream is the most suitable serverless time series database for IoT and operational services. It
            can store trillions of events from these sources. Storing this time series data in Amazon Timestream ensures
            faster processing and is more cost-effective than storing such data in a regular relational database.</p>

        <p>Amazon Timestream is integrated with data collection services in AWS such as Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon MSK,
            and open-source tools such as Telegraf. Data stored in Amazon Timestream can be further visualized using
            Amazon QuickSight. It can also be integrated with Amazon Sagemaker for machine learning.&nbsp;</p>
