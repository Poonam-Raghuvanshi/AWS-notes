  <p class="heading"> Amazon Redshift Spectrum </p>
  <p>Efficiently query and retrieve structured and semistructured data from
    files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables.

    Amazon Redshift Spectrum resides on dedicated Amazon Redshift servers that are independent of your cluster. Redshift
    Spectrum pushes many compute-intensive tasks, such as predicate filtering and aggregation, down to the Redshift
    Spectrum layer. Thus, Redshift Spectrum queries use much less of your cluster's processing capacity than other
    queries.</p>
  <p>
    <li><strong>Option C is CORRECT</strong> because Advanced Query Accelerator or AQUA for Redshift meets all the above
      requirements. Using AQUA, customers can boost the query performance by 10X. It resolves network bandwidth and
      memory processing (CPU) bottleneck, low cost, and is easy to deploy.</li>
