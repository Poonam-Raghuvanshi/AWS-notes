    <p class="main-heading">Amazon DynamoDB</p>
    <p> <b>Key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance </b> at
        any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-master, durable database with built-in security, backup and
        restore, and in-memory caching (via DAX) for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB is not an in-memory database,
        so this
        option is incorrect.

    </p>
    <p class="heading">DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)</p>
    <p> <b>Fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times
            performance improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second</b>.

        DAX is tightly integrated with DynamoDB—you simply provision a DAX cluster, use the DAX client SDK to point your
        existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster, and let DAX handle the rest. DAX is used to natively cache
        DynamoDB
        reads.</p>
    <p class="heading">Global Tables</p>
    <p>Builds upon DynamoDB’s global footprint to provide you with a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master
        database that provides fast, local, read, and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.
        Global Tables replicates your Amazon DynamoDB tables automatically across your choice of AWS regions.</p>
    <p>
        <li><strong>DynamoDB Streams</strong>   capture the changes happening in your DynamoDB Table. You just have
            to create a lambda function that will capture the updates from DynamoDB Streams and invoke the code to post
            the winner-related message on social media. This will satisfy the given requirement.</li>
