    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) </p>
    <p>
        Easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable
        capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup,
        patching, and backups.
    </p>
    <p>With storage autoscaling enabled, when Amazon RDS detects that you are running out of free database space it
        automatically scales up your storage. </p>
    <p class="heading">Configure RDS to use SSL for data in transit </p>
    <p>
        <b> Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when the instance is
            provisioned.</b> For MySQL, you launch the MySQL client using the --ssl_ca parameter to reference the public
        key to encrypt connections. Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and
        your PostgreSQL DB instances. You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL.

    </p>
    <p><b> You cannot SSH into an RDS DB instance.</b></p>
    <p class="heading">Read Replicas : Asynchronous Replication </p>
    <p>Improve your disaster recovery capabilities. <br>
        Scale read operations into an AWS Region closer to your users.<br>
        Make it easier to migrate from a data center in one AWS Region to a data center in another AWS Region. <br>
        Enhanced performance and durability </p>

    <p class="heading">Export snapshots to S3 </p>
    <p>Export RDS DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 bucket. After the data is exported,
        Analyze the exported data using Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift Spectrum.</p>
    <p class="heading">Multi-AZ deployments for high availability</p>
    <p><span class="point">Multi-AZ DB instance deployment-</span> When the deployment has one standby DB
        instance. Has one standby DB instance that provides failover support, but doesn't serve read traffic. <br>
        <span class="point">Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment-</span> When the deployment has two standby DB
        instances. Has standby DB instances that provide failover support and can also serve read traffic.
    </p>
    <p><b>Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication for RDS and asynchronous for Aurora and spans at least two
            Availability Zones within a single region.
            Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or
            Cross-Region</b></p>

    <p class="heading">RDS Custom for Oracle </p>
    <p> Allows you to access and customize your database server host and operating system,
        for example by applying special patches and changing the database software settings to support third-party
        applications that require privileged access. RDS Custom for Oracle facilitates these functionalities with
        minimum infrastructure maintenance effort.</p>
    <img src="../images/comp.PNG" />
    <p>Any database engine level upgrade for an RDS DB instance with Multi-AZ deployment triggers both the primary and
        standby DB instances to be upgraded at the same time. This causes downtime until the upgrade is complete</p>

        <p>Amazon RDS supports TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) with Oracle and SQL servers. With TDE, data is
            automatically encrypted before it is written to storage and automatically decrypted when data is read from
            the storage. TDE in Oracle can be integrated with AWS CloudHSM which can securely store, generate, and
            manage cryptographic keys in a single-tenant Hardware security module.</p>

        <p><strong>Correct Answer:&nbsp;A</strong></p>

        <p>DB snapshot can be shared with other authorized AWS accounts which can be up to 20 accounts. These snapshots
            can be either in encrypted or unencrypted format.</p>

        <p>For manual snapshots in an unencrypted format, accounts can directly restore a DB instance from the snapshot.
        </p>

        <p>For manual snapshots in an encrypted format, accounts first need to copy the snapshot and then restore it to
            a DB instance.</p>

        <p>While sharing a manual unencrypted snapshot, all accounts can use this snapshot to restore to the DB instance
            when DB snapshot visibility is set to public.</p>

        <p>While sharing a manual unencrypted snapshot, only specified accounts can restore a DB instance when DB
            snapshot visibility is set to private.</p>

        <p>In the case of manual encrypted snapshots, the only available option for DB snapshot visibility is private,
            as encrypted snapshots cannot be made public.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option B is incorrect </strong>as marking DB snapshot visibility as the public is not an ideal
                option since snapshots need to share only with specific accounts. Marking DB snapshot visibility as
                public will provide all Amazon accounts access to the manual snapshot and will be able to restore DB
                instances using this snapshot.</li>
            <li><strong>Option C is incorrect</strong> as DB instances can be directly restored from the snapshot for a
                manual unencrypted snapshot. There is no need to create a copy of the snapshot to restore a DB instance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Option D is incorrect </strong>as already discussed, marking DB snapshot visibility as the
                public is not an ideal option. For a manual unencrypted snapshot, DB instances can be directly restored
                from the snapshot.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <p>During automated backup, Amazon RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of the entire Database Instance. RDS
        uploads transaction logs for DB instances to Amazon S3 every 5 minutes. To restore a DB instance at a specific
        point in time, a new DB instance is created using the DB snapshot.</p>
