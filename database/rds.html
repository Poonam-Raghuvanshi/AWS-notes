    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) </p>
    <p>
        Easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable
        capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup,
        patching, and backups.
    </p>
    <p>With storage autoscaling enabled, when Amazon RDS detects that you are running out of free database space it
        automatically scales up your storage. </p>
    <p class="heading">Configure RDS to use SSL for data in transit </p>
    <p>
        <b> Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when the instance is
            provisioned.</b> For MySQL, you launch the MySQL client using the --ssl_ca parameter to reference the public
        key to encrypt connections. Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and
        your PostgreSQL DB instances. You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL.

    </p>
    <p><b> You cannot SSH into an RDS DB instance.</b></p>
    <p class="heading">Read Replicas : Asynchronous Replication </p>
    <p>Improve your disaster recovery capabilities. <br>
        Scale read operations into an AWS Region closer to your users.<br>
        Make it easier to migrate from a data center in one AWS Region to a data center in another AWS Region. <br>
        Enhanced performance and durability </p>

    <p class="heading">Export snapshots to S3 </p>
    <p>Export RDS DB snapshot data to an Amazon S3 bucket. After the data is exported,
        Analyze the exported data using Amazon Athena or Amazon Redshift Spectrum.</p>
    <p class="heading">Multi-AZ deployments for high availability</p>
    <p><span class="point">Multi-AZ DB instance deployment-</span> When the deployment has one standby DB
        instance. Has one standby DB instance that provides failover support, but doesn't serve read traffic. <br>
        <span class="point">Multi-AZ DB cluster deployment-</span> When the deployment has two standby DB
        instances. Has standby DB instances that provide failover support and can also serve read traffic.
    </p>
    <p><b>Multi-AZ follows synchronous replication for RDS and asynchronous for Aurora and spans at least two
            Availability Zones within a single region.
            Read replicas follow asynchronous replication and can be within an Availability Zone, Cross-AZ, or
            Cross-Region</b></p>

    <p class="heading">RDS Custom for Oracle </p>
    <p> Allows you to access and customize your database server host and operating system,
        for example by applying special patches and changing the database software settings to support third-party
        applications that require privileged access. RDS Custom for Oracle facilitates these functionalities with
        minimum infrastructure maintenance effort.</p>
    <img src="../images/comp.PNG" />
    <p>Any database engine level upgrade for an RDS DB instance with Multi-AZ deployment triggers both the primary and
        standby DB instances to be upgraded at the same time. This causes downtime until the upgrade is complete</p>
