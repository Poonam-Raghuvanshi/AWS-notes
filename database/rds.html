    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) </p>
    <p>
        Easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable
        capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup,
        patching, and backups.

    <p class="heading">Configure RDS to use SSL for data in transit </p>
    <p>
        <b> Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate and installs the certificate on the DB instance when the instance is
            provisioned.</b> For MySQL, you launch the MySQL client using the --ssl_ca parameter to reference the public
        key to encrypt connections. Using SSL, you can encrypt a PostgreSQL connection between your applications and
        your PostgreSQL DB instances. You can also force all connections to your PostgreSQL DB instance to use SSL.
