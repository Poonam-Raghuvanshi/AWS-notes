    <ul>
        <li>An Application Load Balancer periodically sends requests to its registered targets to test their status.
            These tests are called health checks.

        </li>
        <li>

            Each load balancer node routes requests only to the healthy targets in the enabled Availability Zones for
            the load balancer. Each load balancer node checks the health of each target, using the health check settings
            for the target groups with which the target is registered. If a target group contains only unhealthy
            registered targets, the load balancer nodes route requests across its unhealthy targets.

        </li>
        <li> <b> You must ensure that your load balancer can communicate with registered targets on both the listener port
            and the health check port. </b> Whenever you add a listener to your load balancer or update the health check port
            for a target group used by the load balancer to route requests, you must verify that the security groups
            associated with the load balancer allow traffic on the new port in both directions.

            Application Load Balancer Configuration for Security Groups and Health Check Routes:</li>
