    <p>Custom resources can be used to write custom provisioning logic in an AWS CloudFormation
        template. While using Custom resources, AWS CloudFormation sends a request to the service token
        specified in the template and processes the stack operation once the response is received.
        Custom resources are associated with either of the following,
        1. Amazon SNS-backed custom resources: A SNS topic is associated with the custom
        resources. Based upon SNS notifications, provisioning logic is invoked in the stack
        t l t
        A.
        Use Custom resources and a Lambda function to create a function that will
        update AMI IDs in the CloudFormation template
        B.
        Map AMI IDs to the specific instance type and regions. Manually update the AMI
        IDs in the CloudFormation templates
        C.
        Use Custom resources along with Amazon SNS which will update AMI IDs in the
        CloudFormation template
        D.
        Use Custom resources along with Amazon SQS which will update AMI IDs in the
        CloudFormation template

        templates.
        2. AWS Lambda-backed custom resources: A Lambda function is associated with the
        custom resources. A lambda function is invoked when a custom resource is updated,
        deleted, or created.</p>

        <p><strong>Correct Answer: D</strong></p>

        <p>The cfn-init helper script is used to retrieve and interpret resource metadata from the
            AWS::CloudFormation::Init key. After reading the metadata, this script performs the following actions,</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fetch and parse metadata from CloudFormation.</li>
            <li>Install packages.</li>
            <li>Write files to disk.</li>
            <li>Enable/disable and start/stop services.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A is incorrect </strong>as the cfn-hup helper script checks for any updates to the
                metadata. If there are any changes, it executes custom hooks.</li>
            <li><strong>Option B is incorrect </strong>as the cfn-signal helper script can be used to signal
                CloudFormation to indicate if software or application is successfully updated on an Amazon EC2 instance.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Option C is incorrect </strong>as the cfn-get-metadata helper script helps to retrieve metadata
                for a resource to a specific key. This will not install services or start services that the cfn-init
                helper script can perform.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection can be used to detect changes made to AWS resources outside
        the&nbsp;CloudFormation Templates. AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection only checks property values explicitly set
        by stack templates or by specifying template parameters. It does not determine drift for property values that
        are set by default. To determine drift for these resources, you can explicitly set property values that can be
        the same as that of the default value.</p>
