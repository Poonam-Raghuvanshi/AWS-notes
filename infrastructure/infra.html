    <p> AWS has regions all around the world.</p>
    <p>A region is a cluster of data centers
        • Most AWS services are region-scoped</p>
    <p>How to choose an AWS Region?</p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="point">Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: </span> data never leaves a region without your explicit
            permission
        </li>
        <li><span class="point"> Proximity to customers:</span> reduced latency </li>
        <li><span class="point"> Available services within a Region: </span> new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
        </li>
        <li><span class="point"> Pricing:</span> pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page </li>
    </ul>
