    <p>Custom resources can be used to write custom provisioning logic in an AWS CloudFormation
        template. While using Custom resources, AWS CloudFormation sends a request to the service token
        specified in the template and processes the stack operation once the response is received.
        Custom resources are associated with either of the following,
        1. Amazon SNS-backed custom resources: A SNS topic is associated with the custom
        resources. Based upon SNS notifications, provisioning logic is invoked in the stack
        t l t
        A.
        Use Custom resources and a Lambda function to create a function that will
        update AMI IDs in the CloudFormation template
        B.
        Map AMI IDs to the specific instance type and regions. Manually update the AMI
        IDs in the CloudFormation templates
        C.
        Use Custom resources along with Amazon SNS which will update AMI IDs in the
        CloudFormation template
        D.
        Use Custom resources along with Amazon SQS which will update AMI IDs in the
        CloudFormation template

        templates.
        2. AWS Lambda-backed custom resources: A Lambda function is associated with the
        custom resources. A lambda function is invoked when a custom resource is updated,
        deleted, or created.</p>

        <p><strong>Correct Answer:&nbsp;A</strong></p>

        <p>AWS Application Discovery Service collects data from existing servers at on-premises which can be used by the
            customers to understand server configurations, usage, and behavior. It gathers various server parameters
            such as CPU, disk, memory, and network. This collected data is encrypted in transit as well as at rest.
            These parameters can be discovered in any of the following two ways.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Agentless Discovery: This is suited for VMware hosts. With this method, an OVA (Open Virtual Appliance)
                needs to be deployed on a VM host associated with VMware vCenter. No additional software is required to
                discover the required parameters. This agent can collect the required information irrespective of the
                operating systems installed on the VMs.</li>
            <li>Agent-based Discovery: Agent-based discovery is suitable for collecting data for hosts other than VMware
                hosts. With this, agents are deployed on machines having Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, and SUSE
                operating systems.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option B is incorrect </strong>as AWS Server Migration Service performs migration of the
                application from on-premises to AWS Cloud. It’s not the service to identify server parameters such as
                CPU, and memory of the on-premises servers. For migrating VMware hosts to the Amazon EC2 instance, AWS
                Server Migration Service Connector can be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Option C is incorrect</strong> as AWS Server Migration Service performs migration of the
                application from on-premises to AWS Cloud. It’s not the service to identify server parameters such as
                CPU, and memory of the on-premises servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Option D is incorrect </strong>as Agent-based discovery with AWS Application Discovery Service
                is best suited for VMs and physical servers having Windows and Linux operating systems. For VMs
                associated with vCentre, Agentless discovery is the best option, not an agent-based discovery method.
            </li>
        </ul>
