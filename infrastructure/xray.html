    <p>AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves and provides tools that you
        can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization.
    </p>
    <li> AWS X-ray collects data, analysis, and debugs of microservice
        applications. Amazon X-Ray helps to analyze and debug modern applications. It will also collect the traces of
        the request from each of the applications. It also records the traces. After recording, it can create a view
        service map that can be seen to&nbsp;trace data latency and analyze the issues.&nbsp;<br>
        Insights feature helps to create notifications that alert your team in real-time. Notifications
        help&nbsp;respond more quickly when troubleshooting is required, thus improving application availability.</li>
