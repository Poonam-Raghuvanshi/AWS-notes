    <p class="main-heading"> AWS DataSync</p>

    <p>
        Data-transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving and replicating data
        between <b> on-premise and AWS storage services over the internet or AWS Direct Connect </b>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> Use cases</p>
    <p>
        <span class="point"> Data migration </span> – into Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, FSx for Windows File Server, FSx for
        Lustre, or FSx for OpenZFS. DataSync includes automatic encryption and data integrity validation. <br />

        <span class="point"> Archiving cold data </span> – directly to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep
        Archive. <br />

        <span class="point"> Data protection </span>– <br />

        <span class="point"> Data movement for timely in-cloud processing </span> – Move data in or out of AWS for
        processing. These include machine learning in the life-sciences industry, video production in media and
        entertainment, big-data analytics in financial services, and seismic research in the oil and gas industry.
    </p>
    <p>AWS recommends that you should use AWS DataSync to migrate existing data to Amazon S3, and subsequently use the
        File Gateway configuration of AWS Storage Gateway to retain access to the migrated data and for ongoing updates
        from your on-premises file-based applications. Therefore, both these options are incorrect, as they use DataSync
        for ongoing replication.</p>
    <p>AWS AppSync one can create serverless GraphQL
        APIs that simplify application development by providing a single endpoint to securely
        query or update data from multiple data sources and leverage GraphQL to implement
        engaging real-time application experiences.</p>
