    <p class="main-heading"> AWS Schema Conversion Tool</p>

    <p>
        Convert your existing database schema from one database engine to another. You can convert relational OLTP
        schema, or data warehouse schema. Your converted schema is suitable for an Amazon Relational Database Service
        (Amazon RDS) MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL DB, an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, or an Amazon
        Redshift cluster. The converted schema can also be used with a database on an Amazon EC2 instance or stored as
        data on an Amazon S3 bucket.

        AWS SCT supports several industry standards, including Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), for
        connections to an Amazon S3 bucket or another AWS resource. AWS SCT is also compliant with Federal Risk and
        Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP).
