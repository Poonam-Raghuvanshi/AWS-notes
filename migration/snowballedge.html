    <p>
        Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to <b>securely and quickly transfer dozens of
            terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS</b> . It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of
        SATA SSD
        storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.
        As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take
        care of the data transfer for all applications. </p>
    <p>The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service
        and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer.
    </p>
    <p>AWS Snowmobile is an Exabyte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS. You
        can transfer up to 100PB per Snowmobile, a 45-foot long ruggedized shipping container, pulled by a semi-trailer
        truck. Snowmobile makes it easy to move massive volumes of data to the cloud, including video libraries, image
        repositories, or even a complete data center migration. Transferring data with Snowmobile is more secure, fast,
        and cost-effective. AWS recommends using Snowmobile to migrate large datasets of 10PB or more in a single
        location. For datasets less than 10PB or distributed in multiple locations, you should use Snowball.</p>
