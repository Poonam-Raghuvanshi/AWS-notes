        Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to <b>securely and quickly transfer dozens of
            terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS</b> . It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage, 40 vCPUs, 1 TB of
        SATA SSD
        storage, and up to 40 Gb network connectivity to address large scale data transfer and pre-processing use cases.
        As each Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device can handle 80TB of data, you can order 10 such devices to take
        care of the data transfer for all applications. </p>
    <p>The original Snowball devices were transitioned out of service
        and Snowball Edge Storage Optimized are now the primary devices used for data transfer.
