        <p>AWS Application Discovery Service collects data from existing servers at on-premises which can be used by the
            customers to understand server configurations, usage, and behavior. It gathers various server parameters
            such as CPU, disk, memory, and network. This collected data is encrypted in transit as well as at rest.
            These parameters can be discovered in any of the following two ways.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Agentless Discovery: This is suited for VMware hosts. With this method, an OVA (Open Virtual Appliance)
                needs to be deployed on a VM host associated with VMware vCenter. No additional software is required to
                discover the required parameters. This agent can collect the required information irrespective of the
                operating systems installed on the VMs.</li>
            <li>Agent-based Discovery: Agent-based discovery is suitable for collecting data for hosts other than VMware
                hosts. With this, agents are deployed on machines having Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, CentOS, and SUSE
                operating systems.</li>
        </ol>
