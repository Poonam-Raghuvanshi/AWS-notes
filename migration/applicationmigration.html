<div>
    <p>AWS Application Migration Service can be used to migrate on-premises servers to AWS. It supports applications such as SAP, Oracle, and SQL server migrations to AWS Cloud. While using AWS Application Migration Service, there is no need to have any application-specific experts to perform migration or have multiple migration solutions to be designed.<br>
    This allows us to save costs while migrating critical applications to the cloud. With AWS Application Migration Service, data from source servers is first replicated to AWS. Post data is replicated to AWS; tests are performed to ensure application performance from the AWS cloud, and once tests are passed, cutover is performed. This ensures a small cutover window without any disruption to application performance.</p>
