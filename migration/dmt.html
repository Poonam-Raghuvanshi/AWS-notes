    <p class="main-heading"> AWS Database Migration Service</p>

    <p> Helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. </p>

    <p>The source database
        remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database.
    </p>

    <p>AWS Database Migration Service supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous
        migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server to Amazon Aurora.</p>
    <p> AWS DMS lets you expand the existing application to stream data from
        Amazon S3 into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for real-time analytics without writing and maintaining new code. AWS
        DMS supports specifying Amazon S3 as the source and streaming services like Kinesis and Amazon Managed Streaming
        of Kafka (Amazon MSK) as the target.</p>
    <p> AWS DMS allows migration of full and change data capture (CDC) files to these services. AWS DMS performs this
        task out of box without any complex configuration or code development. You
        can also configure an AWS DMS replication instance to scale up or down depending on the workload.
    </p>
    <p>AWS DMS supports Amazon S3 as the source and Kinesis as the target, so data stored in an S3 bucket is streamed
        to Kinesis. Several consumers, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics,
        and the Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL), can consume the data concurrently to perform real-time analytics on the
        dataset. Each AWS service in this architecture can scale independently as needed.</p>
    <p>With AWS Database Migration Service, you can continuously replicate your data with high availability and
        consolidate databases into a petabyte-scale data warehouse by streaming data to Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3.
