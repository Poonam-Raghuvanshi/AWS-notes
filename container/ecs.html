        <li> <b> Fully managed container orchestration service.</b> </li>
        <li> ECS allows you to easily run, scale, and secure Docker container applications on AWS. </li>

            <b>ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. ECS with Fargate launch
                type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type supports the following networking mode,
        1. Host Mode: This is a basic mode in which the networking of the container is directly
        tied to the underlying host.
        2. Bridge Mode: In this mode, a network bridge is created between host and container
        networking. This bridge mode allows the remapping of ports between host and
        container ports.
        3. None mode: In this mode, networking is not attached to the container. With this mode,
        containers do not have external connectivity.
        4. AWSVPC Mode: In this mode, each task is allocated a separate ENI (Elastic Network
        Interface) Each Task will receive a separate IP address and a separate security group
    </p>
    <p>Amazon ECS can be deployed in AWS Outposts to provide the least latency from the on-premises
        location. With AWS Outposts, the EC2 launch type is only supported with Amazon ECS. EC2 launch type
        is best suited when there is a requirement of consistent high CPU and memory for container-based
        applications.</p>

        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <strong>A</strong></p>

        <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is a feature of Amazon ECS that enables you to run and manage
            container workloads on customer-managed infrastructure efficiently.<br>
            ECS Anywhere builds upon the ease and simplicity of Amazon ECS to provide a consistent tooling and API
            experience across your container-based applications.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A is CORRECT </strong>because you need AWS Systems Manager to supply a secret activation
                code that allows the agent to register itself with AWS Systems Manager as a managed instance, which is
                necessary to run your instances on ECS Anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, it is necessary for the Amazon ECS agent to have connectivity with your ECS Cluster.<br>
            Docker is used if you want to run container workloads on-prem.<br>
            And you can apply the following command on your Linux instance to register to the Amazon ECS:</p>

        <p>curl --proto "https" -o "/tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh"
            "https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install-latest.sh" &amp;&amp; bash
            /tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh --region "YourRegion" --cluster "Cluster-name" --activation-id
            "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx" --activation-code "xxxxxxxxx"</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option B is incorrect </strong>because Amazon ECS agents must also be included, if not, the
                servers canâ€™t be registered on the ECS cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Option C is incorrect </strong>because Amazon Systems Manager Agent must also be included, if
                not, the servers will not be registered as managed instances and will not complete the registration of
                the servers into the ECS Cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Option D is incorrect </strong>as we are missing the Amazon Systems Manager Agent. Amazon
                CloudWatch&nbsp; agent would provide the possibility to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch , but the
                servers will not be able to register.</li>
        </ul>
