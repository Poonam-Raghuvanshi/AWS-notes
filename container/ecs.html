            <b>ECS with EC2 launch type is charged based on EC2 instances and EBS volumes used. ECS with Fargate launch
                type is charged based on vCPU and memory resources that the containerized application requests</b>

    </ul>
    <p>Amazon ECS with EC2 launch type supports the following networking mode,
        1. Host Mode: This is a basic mode in which the networking of the container is directly
        tied to the underlying host.
        2. Bridge Mode: In this mode, a network bridge is created between host and container
        networking. This bridge mode allows the remapping of ports between host and
        container ports.
        3. None mode: In this mode, networking is not attached to the container. With this mode,
        containers do not have external connectivity.
        4. AWSVPC Mode: In this mode, each task is allocated a separate ENI (Elastic Network
        Interface) Each Task will receive a separate IP address and a separate security group
    </p>
    <p>Amazon ECS can be deployed in AWS Outposts to provide the least latency from the on-premises
        location. With AWS Outposts, the EC2 launch type is only supported with Amazon ECS. EC2 launch type
        is best suited when there is a requirement of consistent high CPU and memory for container-based
        applications.</p>
