    <p>Amazon EKS Anywhere builds on the strengths of Amazon EKS Distro<strong> </strong>and provides open-source
        software thatâ€™s up-to-date and patched. So you can have a Kubernetes environment on-premises that is more
        reliable than self-managed Kubernetes offerings.</p>
    <p>Amazon EKS Anywhere is a deployment option for Amazon EKS that allows customers to create and operate Kubernetes
        clusters on customer-managed infrastructure, supported by AWS.</p>

    <p>
        <li> Amazon EKS Distro includes open-source Kubernetes components,
            Kubernetes Control Plane components (kube-controller-manager, etcd, and CoreDNS), Kubernetes Node components
            (kubelet, Kubernetes CSI, and CNI), and command-line clients (kubectl and etcdctl).</li>
    </p>
    <p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service can be used to set up open-source Container orchestration like Kubernetes.
        Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service can be integrated with other public or private clouds. AWS Fargate can be used
        as a serverless compute for deploying containers. With AWS Fargate, there is no need to set back-end
        infrastructure for containers. With AWS Fargate, based upon task definitions, containers are launched. The
        following diagram depicts the deployment of AWS Kubernetes, with AWS Fargate, serverless containers can be
        deployed while using Amazon EC2, compute nodes are deployed manually as per requirement. Using Amazon EC2
        provides more control on back-end infrastructure for containers. But customers have to perform management of
        these instances.</p>
