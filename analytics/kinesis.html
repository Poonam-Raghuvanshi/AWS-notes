    <p class="main-heading">Amazon Kinesis</p>
    <p>
        It makes it easy to <b> collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data </b> so you can get timely
        insights and react quickly to new information.
    <ul>
        <li>Cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale, along with the flexibility to choose the tools that
            best suit the requirements of your application.</li>
        <li>You can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams,
            and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications.</li>
        <li>It respond instantly instead of having to wait until all your data
            is collected before the processing can begin.</li>
        <li> Kinesis will be great for event streaming from the IoT devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="heading">FAN out pattern</p>
    <p>KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website
        clickstreams, database event streams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking
        events. By default, the 2MB/second/shard output is shared between all of the applications consuming data from
        the stream. </p>
    <p> <b> You should use enhanced fan-out if you have multiple consumers retrieving data from a stream in
            parallel. With enhanced fan-out developers can register stream consumers to use enhanced fan-out and receive
            their own 2MB/second pipe of read throughput per shard, and this throughput automatically scales with the
            number of shards in a stream.</b></p>
    <p class="heading">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose</p>
    <p> Easiest way to reliably <b>load streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics tools</b>. It is a
        fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing
        administration. It can also batch, compress, transform, and encrypt the data before loading it, minimizing the
        amount of storage used at the destination and increasing security. <b> Kinesis Data Firehose can only write to
            S3,Redshift, Elasticsearch or Splunk</b>. </p>
