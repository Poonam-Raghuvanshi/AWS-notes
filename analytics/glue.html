    <p>You can use a crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with tables. This is the primary method used by most
        AWS Glue users.&nbsp;A crawler can crawl multiple data stores in a single run. Upon completion, the crawler
        creates or updates one or more tables in your Data Catalog.&nbsp;The AWS Glue Data Catalog can then be used to
        guide ETL operations.</p>
