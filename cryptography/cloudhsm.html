    <p>To back up the AWS CloudHSM data to Amazon S3 buckets in the same region, AWS CloudHSM generates a unique
        Ephemeral Backup Key (EBK) to encrypt all data using AES 256-bit encryption key. This Ephemeral Backup Key (EBK)
        is further encrypted using Persistent Backup Key (PBK), which is also an AES 256-bit encryption key.</p>
