    <p>
        Makes it easy and cost-effective to launch and run the world’s most popular
        high-performance file system.</p>
    <p> It is used for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing
        (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. The open-source Lustre file system is designed for applications
        that require fast storage – where you want your storage to keep up with your compute. </p>
    <p> FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy to process data sets with the Lustre file system. When
        linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you
        to write changed data back to S3.</p>
    <p>
        <b> FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as
            well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3. </b>

    </p>

            (AWS CLI), or the Amazon FSx for Lustre API.</p>
