    <p class="heading"> FSx for Lustre</p>
    <p>
        Makes it easy and cost-effective to launch and run the world’s most popular
        high-performance file system.</p>
    <p> It is used for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing
        (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling. The open-source Lustre file system is designed for applications
        that require fast storage – where you want your storage to keep up with your compute. </p>
    <p> FSx for Lustre integrates with Amazon S3, making it easy to process data sets with the Lustre file system. When
        linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you
        to write changed data back to S3.</p>
    <p>
        <b> FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as
            well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3. </b>

    </p>

        <p>Amazon FSx for Lustre provides two file system deployment options: scratch and persistent.</p>

        <p>Both deployment options support solid-state drive (SSD) storage. However, hard disk drive (HDD) storage is
            supported only in one of the persistent deployment types.</p>

        <p>You choose the file system deployment type when you create a new file system using the AWS Management
            Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the Amazon FSx for Lustre API.</p>

    <p class="heading"> FSx for Windows File Server</p>
    <p>
        Fully managed, highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Service Message Block
        (SMB) protocol. It is built on Windows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative features such as user
        quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration.
    </p>
    <p>FSx for Windows does not allow you to present S3 objects as files and does not allow you to write changed data
        back to S3. </p>
    <p>Amazon FSx supports the use of Microsoft’s Distributed File System (DFS) to organize shares into a single folder
        structure up to hundreds of PB in size.</p>
    <p>For your native Windows workloads and users, or your SMB clients, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides all
        of the benefits of a native Windows SMB environment that is fully managed and secured and scaled like any other
        AWS service. You get detailed reporting, replication, backup, failover, and support for native Windows tools
        like DFS and Active Directory.</p>
    <p>Amazon FSx File Gateway provides low-latency, on-premises access to fully managed file shares in Amazon FSx for
        Windows File Server. </p>
