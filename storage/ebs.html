    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</p>
    <p> <b>For EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) volumes, the charges are $0.10 per GB-month of provisioned storage</b>.</p>
    <p>
        Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. </p>
    <p>Specific Availability Zone - attach it to an instance in that same Availability Zone. To make a volume available
        outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot and
        restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in that Region. You can copy snapshots to other Regions and then
        restore them to new volumes there.</p>
    <p> <b>Persist independently from the life of the instance. </b> You can dynamically change the configuration of a
        volume attached to an instance.</p>
    <p> <b>Encrypted EBS volume attached to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the
            volume, data moving between the volume and the instance, snapshots created from the volume and volumes
            created from those snapshots are all encrypted. </b></p>
    <p> It uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and
        snapshots.</p>
    <p> Encryption operations occur on the servers that host EC2 instances, ensuring the security of both data-at-rest
        and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached EBS storage.

    <p class="heading"> DELETE ON TERMINATION</p>
    <p>

        When you launch an instance, the root device volume contains the image used to boot the instance. You can choose
        between AMIs backed by Amazon EC2 instance store and AMIs backed by Amazon EBS.

        <b> By default, the root volume for an AMI backed by Amazon EBS is deleted when the instance terminates.</b> You
        can change the default behavior to ensure that the volume persists after the instance terminates. Non-root EBS
        volumes remain available even after you terminate an instance to which the volumes were attached.
    </p>
    <p>If the instance is already running, you can set DeleteOnTermination to False using the command line.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Volume Types</p>
    <p>
        <span class="point"> General Purpose SSD volumes IPOS- 16,000 Throughput-1000</span> -
        <b> Balance price and performance for a wide variety of transactional workloads. Use case- boot volumes,
            medium-size single instance databases, and development and test environments.</b>
    </p>

    <p><span class="point"> Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes : IPOS- 256,000 Throughput-4000</span> -
        <b> I/O-intensive workloads </b>that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency.
        They provide a consistent IOPS rate that you specify when you create the volume. This enables you to predictably
        scale to tens of thousands of IOPS per instance. <b>Most durable - io2 volumes </b>.
    </p>
    <p><span class="point"> Throughput Optimized HDD volumes IPOS- 500 Throughput-500</span> -
        ideal for large, sequential workloads - <b>Amazon EMR, ETL, data warehouses, and log processing </b>.

    </p>
    <p> <span class="point"> Cold HDD volumes (sc1)</span> - provide low-cost magnetic storage for infrequent access
        to your data. </b>.</p>
    <p>RAID 1 when fault tolerance is more important than I/O performance</p>
    <p>Multi-attach EBS volumes are supported only for Nitro EC2 instances which are Linux-based.</p>
    <p>
        You can use the
        <strong>e2label</strong> command to change the label of the attached volume that you do not want to boot
        from.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager can be used for creation, retention &amp; deletion of EBS snapshots. It protects
        critical data by initiating backup of Amazon EBS volumes at selected intervals, along with storing &amp;
        deletion of old snapshots to save storage space &amp; cost.</p>
