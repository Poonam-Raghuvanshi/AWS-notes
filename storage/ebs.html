    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</p>
    <p>
        Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. </p>
    <p> <b>When
            you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the
            volume, data moving between the volume and the instance, snapshots created from the volume and volumes
            created from those snapshots are all encrypted. </b></p>
    <p> It uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and
        snapshots.</p>
    <p> Encryption operations occur on the servers that host EC2 instances, ensuring the security of both data-at-rest
        and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached EBS storage.
