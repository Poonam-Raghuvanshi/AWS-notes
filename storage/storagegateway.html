    <p class="main-heading"> AWS Storage Gateway</p>

    <p>AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited
        cloud storage. </p>
    <p class="heading"> Amazon S3 File Gateway</p>
    <p> Supports a file interface into Amazon S3 and combines a service and a virtual software appliance. <b>You can
            store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as
            Network File System (NFS) and
            Server Message Block (SMB)</b>.

        You can manage your S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. You can think of
        a S3 File Gateway as a file system mount on Amazon S3.
    </p>

    <p>
        A S3 File Gateway simplifies file storage in Amazon S3, integrates to existing applications through
        industry-standard file system protocols, and provides a cost-effective alternative to on-premises storage. It
        also provides low-latency access to data through transparent local caching. A S3 File Gateway manages data
        transfer to and from AWS, buffers applications from network congestion, optimizes and streams data in parallel,
        and manages bandwidth consumption. S3 File Gateway integrate with AWS services, for example with the following:

        Common access management using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

        Encryption using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)

        Monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch (CloudWatch)

        Audit using AWS CloudTrail (CloudTrail)

        Operations using the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)

        Billing and cost management




    </p>
    <p class="heading">Tape Gateway</p>
    <p> <b> Cost-effectively and durably archive backup data in S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval / Deep Archive</b>. A Tape
        Gateway provides a virtual tape infrastructure that scales seamlessly with
        your business needs and eliminates the operational burden of provisioning, scaling, and maintaining a physical
        tape infrastructure.

        You can deploy Storage Gateway either on-premises as a VM appliance running on VMware ESXi, KVM, or Microsoft
        Hyper-V hypervisor, as a hardware appliance, or in AWS as an Amazon EC2 instance. You deploy your gateway on an
        EC2 instance to provision iSCSI storage volumes in AWS. You can use gateways hosted on EC2 instances for
        disaster recovery, data mirroring, and providing storage for applications hosted on Amazon EC2.</p>
    <p class="heading">Volume Gateway</p>
    <p> <b> Mount as Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) devices</b> from your on-premises application
        servers.

        You can deploy a Volume Gateway either on-premises as a VM appliance running on VMware ESXi, KVM, or Microsoft
        Hyper-V hypervisor, as a hardware appliance, or in AWS as an Amazon EC2 instance.

        The gateway supports the following volume configurations:

        Cached volumes – You store your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of
        frequently accessed data subsets locally. Cached volumes offer a substantial cost savings on primary storage and
        minimize the need to scale your storage on-premises. You also retain low-latency access to your frequently
        accessed data.

        Stored volumes – If you need low-latency access to your entire dataset, first configure your on-premises gateway
        to store all your data locally. Then asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to Amazon S3.
        This configuration provides durable and inexpensive offsite backups that you can recover to your local data
        center or Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). For example, if you need replacement capacity for disaster
        recovery, you can recover the backups to Amazon EC2.</p>
