    <p class="main-heading">Amazon S3</p>

    <p>
        You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual web pages include static
        content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an
        Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. <br> When you configure
        a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index
        document. Depending on your website requirements, you can also configure redirects, web traffic logging, and a
        custom error document.

        <b> Distributing the static content through S3 allows us to offload most of the network usage to S3 and free up
            our applications running on ECS.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="heading">S3 Bucket Policies</p>
    <p>Bucket policies in Amazon S3 can be used to add or deny permissions across some or all of the objects within a
        single bucket. Policies can be attached to users, groups, or Amazon S3 buckets, enabling centralized management
        of permissions. With bucket policies, you can grant users within your AWS Account or other AWS Accounts access
        to your Amazon S3 resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>You can further restrict access to specific resources based on certain conditions. For example, you can
            restrict access based on request time (Date Condition), whether the request was sent using SSL (Boolean
            Conditions), a requesterâ€™s IP address (IP Address Condition), or based on the requester's client application
            (String Conditions). To identify these conditions, you use policy keys.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="heading">S3 Versioning</p>
    <p> Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to
        preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket.
        Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.</p>
    <p class="heading">Enable MFA delete on the bucket</p>
    <p>To provide additional protection, multi-factor authentication (MFA) delete can
        be enabled. MFA delete requires secondary authentication to take place before objects can be permanently deleted
        from an Amazon S3 bucket. </p>
