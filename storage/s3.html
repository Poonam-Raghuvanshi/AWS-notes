        You can use Amazon S3 to host a static website. On a static website, individual web pages include static
        content. They might also contain client-side scripts. To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an
        Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. <br> When you configure
        a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index
        document. Depending on your website requirements, you can also configure redirects, web traffic logging, and a
        custom error document.

        <b> Distributing the static content through S3 allows us to offload most of the network usage to S3 and free up
            our applications running on ECS.</b>
