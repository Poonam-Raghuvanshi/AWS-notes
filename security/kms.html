        AWS Key Management Service (KMS) makes it easy for you to create and manage cryptographic keys and control their
        use across a wide range of AWS services and in your applications. AWS KMS is a secure and resilient service that
        uses hardware security modules that have been validated under FIPS 140-2.

    <p class="heading">Deleting a customer master key (CMK) in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)</p>
    <p>
        <b>AWS KMS enforces a waiting period. To delete a CMK in AWS KMS you schedule key deletion.
            You can set the waiting period from a minimum of 7 days up to a maximum of 30 days</b>. The default waiting
        period
        is 30 days. During the waiting period, <b>the CMK status and key state is Pending deletion</b>. To recover the
        CMK, you
        can cancel key deletion before the waiting period ends. After the waiting period ends you cannot cancel key
        deletion, and AWS KMS deletes the CMK.

    </p>
    <p>AWS KMS supports multi-region keys, which are AWS KMS keys in different AWS regions that can be used
        interchangeably</p>
