    <p class="main-heading"> AWS Secrets Manager</p>
    <p>
        AWS Secrets Manager helps you protect secrets needed to access your applications, services, and IT resources.
        The service enables you to easily rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets
        throughout their lifecycle. Users and applications retrieve secrets with a call to Secrets Manager APIs,
        eliminating the need to hardcode sensitive information in plain text. Secrets Manager offers secret rotation
        with built-in integration for Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DocumentDB.

    </p>
    <p> For API keys, users must provide the code for the Lambda function that rotates the secrets.</p>
    <li><strong> AWS Config rule “secretsmanager-rotation-enabled-check”
        checks whether AWS Secrets Manager secret has rotation enabled. Users need to add the rule in AWS Config and set
        up a notification</strong>.</li>
