    <p>

        <b>Web application firewall service </b>that lets you monitor web requests and protect your web
        applications from malicious requests. Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you
        specify, such as the IP addresses. You can also use AWS WAF preconfigured protections to block common attacks
        like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

    </p>
    <p>You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web
        access control list (web ACL). Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF allows you to use AWS WAF to
        restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can
        choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access. </p>
