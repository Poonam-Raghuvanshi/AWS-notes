    <p>

        <b>Web application firewall service </b>that lets you monitor web requests and protect your web
        applications from malicious requests. Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you
        specify, such as the IP addresses. You can also use AWS WAF preconfigured protections to block common attacks
        like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

    </p>
    <p>You can use AWS WAF with your Application Load Balancer to allow or block requests based on the rules in a web
        access control list (web ACL). Geographic (Geo) Match Conditions in AWS WAF allows you to use AWS WAF to
        restrict application access based on the geographic location of your viewers. With geo match conditions you can
        choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access. </p>
    <p>When you use AWS WAF with CloudFront, you can protect your applications running on any HTTP webserver, whether
        it's a webserver that's running in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or a web server that you manage
        privately. You can also configure CloudFront to require HTTPS between CloudFront and your own webserver, as well
        as between viewers and CloudFront.
        AWS WAF is tightly integrated with Amazon CloudFront and the Application Load Balancer (ALB), services that AWS
        customers commonly use to deliver content for their websites and applications. When you use AWS WAF on Amazon
        CloudFront, your rules run in all AWS Edge Locations, located around the world close to your end-users. This
        means security doesnâ€™t come at the expense of performance. Blocked requests are stopped before they reach your
        web servers. When you use AWS WAF on Application Load Balancer, your rules run in the region and can be used to
        protect internet-facing as well as internal load balancers.
    </p>
    <p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of the request from the source IP address and takes action once the
        limits are crossed. Following are customized rate-based rules which can be used for application
        protection,
        1. Blanket rate-based rule: Prevents source IP address from making excessive requests
        to entire applications.
        2. URI-specific rate-based rule: Prevents IP address from making excessive requests to
        the URI (Uniform Request Identifier) of the application. These are useful if specific
        functions of the applications, such as computationally expensive resources need to
        be protected from excessive requests.
        3. IP reputation rate-based rule: Prevents well-known malicious IP addresses from
        making excessive requests to the application.</p>
