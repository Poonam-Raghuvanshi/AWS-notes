    <p>
        A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. You can leverage Amazon
        Cognito User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers,
        such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party,
        all members of the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit
        (SDK).<br>
        User pools provide: 1. Sign-up and sign-in services. 2. A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users. 3.
        Social sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as sign-in with SAML
        identity providers from your user pool. 4. User directory management and user profiles. 5. Security features
        such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and
        phone and email verification. 6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.
        After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer
        that uses the user pool.

    <p class="heading"> Identity pools</p>
    <p>Provide AWS credentials to grant your users access to other AWS services. To enable users in your
        user pool to access AWS resources, you can configure an identity pool to exchange user pool tokens for AWS
        credentials.</p>
    <li>Option A is correct. OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers (IdPs) (like Salesforce or Ping Identity) are
        supported in Cognito, along with social and SAML based identity providers. You can add an OIDC IdP to your user
        pool in the AWS Management Console, with the AWS CLI, or with the user pool API method CreateIdentityProvider.
