    <p>

        AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also known as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, enables your
        directory-aware workloads and AWS resources to use managed Active Directory in the AWS Cloud. AWS Managed
        Microsoft AD is built on the actual Microsoft Active Directory and does not require you to synchronize or
        replicate data from your existing Active Directory to the cloud.

    </p>
    <p>AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to set up and run Microsoft Active Directory with other AWS services
        such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS for SQL Server, FSx for Windows File Server, and AWS IAM Identity Center
        (successor to AWS Single Sign-On). </p>
    <p>AWS Managed Microsoft AD is your best choice if you need actual Active Directory features to support AWS
        applications or Windows workloads, including Amazon Relational Database Service for Microsoft SQL Server. </p>
