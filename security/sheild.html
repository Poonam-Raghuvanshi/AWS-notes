    <p>

        If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield
        Advanced by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS Management Console or API. You will pay the
        monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the
        AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.
