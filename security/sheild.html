    <p>
        If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield
        Advanced by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS Management Console or API. You will pay the
        monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single consolidated billing, and you own all the
        AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.

    </p>
    <p>AWS Shield Advanced - For higher levels of protection against attacks targeting your applications running on
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and
        Amazon Route 53 resources, you can subscribe to AWS Shield Advanced. In addition to the network and transport
        layer protections that come with Standard, AWS Shield Advanced provides additional detection and mitigation
        against large and sophisticated DDoS attacks, near real-time visibility into attacks, and integration with AWS
        WAF, a web application firewall. AWS Shield Advanced also gives you 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team
        (DRT) and protection against DDoS-related spikes in your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load
        Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route 53 charges.</p>
