    <p>
        AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with
        any AWS account or within your AWS Organization. You can share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License
        Manager configurations, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules resources with RAM. RAM eliminates the need to create
        duplicate resources in multiple accounts, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in every
        single account you own. You can create resources centrally in a multi-account environment, and use RAM to share
        those resources across accounts in three simple steps: create a Resource Share, specify resources, and specify
        accounts.
