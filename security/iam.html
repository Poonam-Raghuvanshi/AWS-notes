    <p class="heading">EC2 Instance Access </p>
    <p>Instead, you should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance.
        When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and password or
        access keys) to an EC2 instance. The role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they
        make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with
        the instance. Applications that run on the instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign
        API requests.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Lambda Access S3 </p>
    <p>If the IAM role that you create for the Lambda function is in the same AWS account as the bucket, then you don't
        need to grant Amazon S3 permissions on both the IAM role and the bucket policy. Instead, you can grant the
        permissions on the IAM role and then verify that the bucket policy doesn't explicitly deny access to the Lambda
        function role. If the IAM role and the bucket are in different accounts, then you need to grant Amazon S3
        permissions on both the IAM role and the bucket policy. Therefore, this is the right way of giving access to AWS
        Lambda for the given use-case.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Policy types </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Identity-based policies </span> – Attach managed and inline policies to IAM identities
        (users, groups to which users belong, or roles). Grant permissions to an identity.
    </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Resource-based policies </span> – Attach inline policies to resources (examples- Amazon S3
        bucket policies and IAM role trust policies). Grant permissions to the principal that is specified in
        the policy. Principals can be in the same account as the resource or in other accounts.
    </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Permissions boundaries</span> – Use a managed policy as the permissions boundary for an IAM
        entity (user or role). That policy defines the maximum permissions that the identity-based policies can grant to
        an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a
        resource-based policy can grant to an entity.
    </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Organizations SCPs </span>– Use an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) to define
        the maximum permissions for account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). SCPs limit
        permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies grant to entities (users or roles) within
        the account, but do not grant permissions. SCPs don't affect users or roles in the management account. They
        affect only the member accounts in your organization.
    </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Access control lists (ACLs)</span> – Use ACLs to control which principals in other accounts
        can access the resource to which the ACL is attached. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they
        are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document structure. ACLs are cross-account
        permissions policies that grant permissions to the specified principal. ACLs cannot grant permissions to
        entities within the same account.
    </p>
    <p>

        <span class="point"> Session policies</span> – Pass advanced session policies when you use the AWS CLI or AWS
        API to assume a role or a federated user. Session policies limit the permissions that the role or user's
        identity-based policies grant to the session. Session policies limit permissions for a created session, but do
        not grant permissions.
    </p>
    <p>s3:ListBucket is applied to buckets, so the ARN is in the form "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::mybucket", without a
        trailing / s3:GetObject is applied to objects within the bucket, so the ARN is in the form
        "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*", with a trailing /* to indicate all objects within the bucket mybucket</p>

    <p class="heading"> IAM permission boundary </p>

    <p>AWS supports permissions boundaries for IAM entities (users or roles). A permissions boundary is an advanced
        feature for using a managed policy to set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an
        IAM entity. An entity's permissions boundary allows it to perform only the actions that are allowed by both its
        identity-based policies and its permissions boundaries. </p>
    <p>If you are going to use the role with Amazon EC2 or another AWS service that uses Amazon EC2, you must store the
        role in an instance profile. An instance profile is a container for a role that can be attached to an Amazon EC2
        instance when launched. An instance profile can contain only one role, and that limit cannot be increased. If
        you create the role using the AWS Management Console, the instance profile is created for you with the same name
        as the role.</p>
    <p>
    <p>Cross-account IAM roles&nbsp;allow customers to securely grant access to AWS resources in their account to a
        third party, like an APN Partner, while retaining the ability to control and audit who is accessing their AWS
        account. Cross-account roles reduce the amount of sensitive information APN Partners need to store for their
        customers so that they can focus on their product instead of managing keys.</p>
