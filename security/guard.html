    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon GuardDuty</p>
    <p><b>GuardDuty is a regional service.</b></p>
    <p>
        <b> Threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and
            unauthorized behavior </b> to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, and data stored in Amazon S3.
    </p>
    <p>With GuardDuty, you now have an intelligent and cost-effective option for continuous threat detection in AWS. The
        service uses machine learning, anomaly detection, and integrated threat intelligence (malicious IP addresses) to
        identify and prioritize potential threats.
    </p>
    <p>GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, such as <b>AWS CloudTrail
            Management and S3 data events, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs. </b> </p>

    <p>
        With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, GuardDuty can be enabled with no software or hardware to deploy
        or maintain. <b>By integrating with Amazon EventBridge Events, GuardDuty alerts are actionable, </b> easy to
        aggregate across multiple accounts, and straightforward to push into existing event management and workflow
        systems.
    </p>
    <p> GuardDuty has a <b> multiple account management feature </b>, allowing you to associate and manage multiple AWS accounts from a single administrator account.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Disable the service in the general settings</p>
    <p> Disabling the service will <b>delete all remaining data, including your findings and configurations before
            relinquishing the service permissions and resetting the service</b> .

    </p>
    <p class="heading"> Suspend the service in the general settings</p>
    <p>
        You can stop Amazon GuardDuty from analyzing your data sources at any time by choosing to suspend the service in
        the general settings.<b> This will immediately stop the service from analyzing data, but does not delete your
            existing findings or configurations.</b>
