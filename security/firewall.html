    <p>
        AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service which allows you to centrally configure and manage
        firewall rules across your accounts and applications in AWS Organizations. As new applications are created,
        Firewall Manager makes it easy to bring new applications and resources into compliance by enforcing a common set
        of security rules. Now you have a single service to build firewall rules, create security policies, and enforce
        them in a consistent, hierarchical manner across your entire infrastructure.
   <b>    Using AWS Firewall Manager, you can centrally configure AWS WAF rules, AWS Shield Advanced protection, Amazon
        Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) security groups, AWS Network Firewalls, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall
        rules across accounts and resources in your organization. It does not support Network ACLs as of today.</b>
