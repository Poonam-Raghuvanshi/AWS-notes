    <p class="main-heading">AWS Direct Connect</p>
    <p> <b>AWS Direct Connect does not involve the Internet; instead, it uses dedicated, private network connections
            between your intranet and Amazon VPC</b>. </p>
    <p>

        Public virtual interface
        To connect to AWS resources that are reachable by a public IP address such as an Amazon Simple Storage Service
        (Amazon S3) bucket or AWS public endpoints, use a public virtual interface. With a public virtual interface, you
        can:

        Connect to all AWS public IP addresses globally.
        Create public virtual interfaces in any Direct Connect location to receive Amazonâ€™s global IP routes.
        Access publicly routable Amazon services in any AWS Region (except the AWS China Region).
        Private virtual interface
        To connect to your resources hosted in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) using their private IP
        addresses, use a private virtual interface. With a private virtual interface, you can:

        Connect VPC resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances or load balancers on your
        private IP address or endpoint.
        Connect a private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway. Then, associate the Direct Connect gateway with
        one or more virtual private gateways in any AWS Region (except the AWS China Region).
        Connect to multiple Amazon VPCs in any AWS Region (except the AWS China Region), because a virtual private
        gateway is associated with a single VPC.
        Note: For a private virtual interface, AWS advertises the VPC CIDR only over the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
        neighbor. AWS can't advertise or suppress specific subnet blocks in the Amazon VPC for a private virtual
        interface.

        Transit virtual interface
        To connect to your resources hosted in an Amazon VPC (using their private IP addresses) through a transit
        gateway, use a transit virtual interface. With a transit virtual interface, you can:

        Connect multiple Amazon VPCs in the same or different AWS account using Direct Connect.
        Associate up to three transit gateways in any AWS Region when you use a transit virtual interface to connect to
        a Direct Connect gateway.
        Attach Amazon VPCs in the same AWS Region to the transit gateway. Then, access multiple VPCs in different AWS
        accounts in the same AWS Region using a transit virtual interface.
        Note: For transit virtual interface, AWS advertises only routes that you specify in the allowed prefixes list on
        the Direct Connect gateway. For a list of all AWS Regions that offer Direct Connect support for AWS Transit
        Gateway
    </p>
    <p>You can combine one or more AWS Direct Connect dedicated network connections with the Amazon VPC VPN. This
        combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs, increases bandwidth
        throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than internet-based VPN connections.
