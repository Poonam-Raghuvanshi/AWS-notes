        AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services
        developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx,
        Passenger, and IIS.

        You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity
        provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full
        control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.

        When you create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, you can specify an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use
        instead of the standard Elastic Beanstalk AMI included in your platform version. A custom AMI can improve
        provisioning times when instances are launched in your environment if you need to install a lot of software that
        isn't included in the standard AMIs.

        Create a Golden AMI with the static installation components already setup - A Golden AMI is an AMI that you
        standardize through configuration, consistent security patching, and hardening. It also contains agents you
        approve for logging, security, performance monitoring, etc. For the given use-case, you can have the static
        installation components already setup via the golden AMI.

        Use EC2 user data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time - EC2 instance user data is the data
        that you specified in the form of a configuration script while launching your instance. You can use EC2 user
        data to customize the dynamic installation parts at boot time, rather than installing the application itself at
        boot time.

        Blue/green deployment is a technique for releasing applications by shifting traffic between two identical
        environments running different versions of the application: "Blue" is the currently running version and "green"
        the new version. This type of deployment allows you to test features in the green environment without impacting
        the currently running version of your application. When you’re satisfied that the green version is working
        properly, you can gradually reroute the traffic from the old blue environment to the new green environment.
        Blue/green deployments can mitigate common risks associated with deploying software, such as downtime and
        rollback capability.

        Use AWS Global Accelerator to distribute a portion of traffic to a particular deployment - AWS Global
        Accelerator is a network layer service that directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network,
        this improves the availability and performance of your internet applications. It provides two static anycast IP
        addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions,
        such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Elastic IP addresses or Amazon EC2 instances,
        in a single or in multiple AWS regions.

        AWS Global Accelerator uses endpoint weights to determine the proportion of traffic that is directed to
        endpoints in an endpoint group, and traffic dials to control the percentage of traffic that is directed to an
        endpoint group (an AWS region where your application is deployed).

        While relying on the DNS service is a great option for blue/green deployments, it may not fit use-cases that
        require a fast and controlled transition of the traffic. Some client devices and internet resolvers cache DNS
        answers for long periods; this DNS feature improves the efficiency of the DNS service as it reduces the DNS
        traffic across the Internet, and serves as a resiliency technique by preventing authoritative name-server
        overloads. The downside of this in blue/green deployments is that you don’t know how long it will take before
        all of your users receive updated IP addresses when you update a record, change your routing preference or when
        there is an application failure.

        With AWS Global Accelerator, you can shift traffic gradually or all at once between the blue and the green
        environment and vice-versa without being subject to DNS caching on client devices and internet resolvers,
        traffic dials and endpoint weights changes are effective within seconds.

        Throttling is the process of limiting the number of requests an authorized program can submit to a given
        operation in a given amount of time.

        Amazon API Gateway, Amazon SQS and Amazon Kinesis - To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many
        requests, Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token
        counts for a request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request
        submissions against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket
        size.

        Amazon SQS - Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to
        decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Amazon SQS offers buffer
        capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency.

        Amazon Kinesis - Amazon Kinesis is a fully managed, scalable service that can ingest, buffer, and process
        streaming data in real-time.

        Use Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration to enable faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - Amazon S3
        Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client
        and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge
        locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

        Use multipart uploads for faster file uploads into the destination S3 bucket - Multipart upload allows you to
        upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload
        these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that
        part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts
        and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider
        using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation. Multipart upload provides
        improved throughput, therefore it facilitates faster file uploads.

        Consolidated billing has not been enabled. All the AWS accounts should fall under a single consolidated billing
        for the monthly fee to be charged only once - If your organization has multiple AWS accounts, then you can
        subscribe multiple AWS Accounts to AWS Shield Advanced by individually enabling it on each account using the AWS
        Management Console or API. You will pay the monthly fee once as long as the AWS accounts are all under a single
        consolidated billing, and you own all the AWS accounts and resources in those accounts.

        Create a new launch configuration to use the correct instance type. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use this
        new launch configuration. Delete the old launch configuration as it is no longer needed

        A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2
        instances. When you create a launch configuration, you specify information for the instances. Include the ID of
        the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, one or more security groups, and a block device
        mapping.

        It is not possible to modify a launch configuration once it is created.

    <p>Leverage AWS Config managed rule to check if any third-party SSL/TLS certificates imported into ACM are marked
        for expiration within 30 days. Configure the rule to trigger an SNS notification to the security team if any
        certificate expires within 30 days

        AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private
        Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and your internal
        connected resources. SSL/TLS certificates are used to secure network communications and establish the identity
        of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks.

        AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how
        the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the
        configurations and relationships change over time.
        Certificates provided by ACM are automatically renewed. ACM does not automatically renew the certificates that
        you import. The rule is NON_COMPLIANT if your certificates are about to expire.</p>

    Use Amazon Cognito User Pools - A user pool is a user directory in Amazon Cognito. You can leverage Amazon Cognito
    User Pools to either provide built-in user management or integrate with external identity providers, such as
    Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Amazon. Whether your users sign-in directly or through a third party, all members of
    the user pool have a directory profile that you can access through a Software Development Kit (SDK).

    User pools provide: 1. Sign-up and sign-in services. 2. A built-in, customizable web UI to sign in users. 3. Social
    sign-in with Facebook, Google, Login with Amazon, and Sign in with Apple, as well as sign-in with SAML identity
    providers from your user pool. 4. User directory management and user profiles. 5. Security features such as
    multi-factor authentication (MFA), checks for compromised credentials, account takeover protection, and phone and
    email verification. 6. Customized workflows and user migration through AWS Lambda triggers.

    After creating an Amazon Cognito user pool, in API Gateway, you must then create a COGNITO_USER_POOLS authorizer
    that uses the user pool.
    <p>
        If you have an existing Identity Provider (IdP), you can use an API Gateway Lambda authorizer to invoke a Lambda
        function to authenticate/validate a given user against your IdP. You can use a Lambda authorizer for custom
        validation logic based on identity metadata.

        A Lambda authorizer can send additional information derived from a bearer token or request context values to
        your backend service. For example, the authorizer can return a map containing user IDs, user names, and scope.
        By using Lambda authorizers, your backend does not need to map authorization tokens to user-centric data,
        allowing you to limit the exposure of such information to just the authorization function.

        When using Lambda authorizers, AWS strictly advises against passing credentials or any sort of sensitive data
        via query string parameters or headers, so this is not as secure as using Cognito User Pools.

        In addition, both these options do not offer built-in user management.

    <p>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a blazing fast in-memory data store that provides sub-millisecond latency to
        power internet-scale real-time applications.

        Amazon ElastiCache for Redis is a great choice for real-time transactional and analytical processing use cases
        such as caching, chat/messaging, gaming leaderboards, geospatial, machine learning, media streaming, queues,
        real-time analytics, and session store.

        ElastiCache for Redis supports replication, high availability, and cluster sharding right out of the box. IAM
        Auth is not supported by ElastiCache.

        Redis authentication tokens enable Redis to require a token (password) before allowing clients to execute
        commands, thereby improving data security.</p>

    <p>A security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. You can add
        rules to each security group that allows traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules
        for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated
        with the security group.</p>

        AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates copying large
        amounts of data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage
        services.

        You can use AWS DataSync to migrate data located on-premises, at the edge, or in other clouds to Amazon S3,
        Amazon EFS, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server, Amazon FSx for Lustre, Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, and Amazon FSx
        for NetApp ONTAP.
    </p>
    <p>To establish a private connection between your virtual private cloud (VPC) and the Amazon EFS API, you can create
        an interface VPC endpoint. You can also access the interface VPC endpoint from on-premises environments or other
        VPCs using AWS VPN, AWS Direct Connect, or VPC peering.

        AWS Direct Connect provides three types of virtual interfaces: public, private, and transit.For the given use
        case, you can send data over the Direct Connect connection to an AWS PrivateLink interface VPC endpoint for
        Amazon EFS by using a private VIF.

        Using task scheduling in AWS DataSync, you can periodically execute a transfer task from your source storage
        system to the destination. You can use the DataSync scheduled task to send the video files to the EFS file
        system every 24 hours.</p>
