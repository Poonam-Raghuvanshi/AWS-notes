    <p>
        With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time
        that you consume—there’s no charge when your code isn’t running. You can run code for virtually any type of
        application or backend service—all with zero administration. 
    </p>
    <p>AWS Lambda can be combined with DynamoDB to process and capture the key-value data from the IoT sources</p>
