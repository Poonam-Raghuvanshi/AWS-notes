    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</p>

    <p> Fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems,
        and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send,
        store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring
        other services to be available. SQS offers two types of message queues.

    <p class="heading"> Standard Queue</p>
    <p>
        Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and <b>at-least-once delivery </b>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> FIFO Queue</p>
    <p> <b>Messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent</b>.</p>
    <p> <b>By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 msg/sec with batching, or up to 300 msg/sec without batching
        </b>. </p>
    <p><b> The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. </b> The suffix counts towards the 80-character
        queue name limit. </p>
    <p>
        Cannot convert an existing standard into FIFO queue. <b>You must either create
            a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO
            queue</b>.
    </p>
