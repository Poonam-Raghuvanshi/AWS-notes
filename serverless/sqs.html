    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</p>

    <p> Fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems,
        and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send,
        store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring
        other services to be available.  SQS offers two types of message queues.

    <p class="heading"> Standard Queue</p>
    <p>
        Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and
        at-least-once delivery.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> FIFO Queue</p>
    <p>SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in
        the exact order that they are sent.</p>
    <p> <b>By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per
            second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching. </b>Therefore, using batching
        you can meet a throughput requirement of upto 3,000 messages per second. </p>
    <p>
        <b> The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. </b> The suffix counts towards the 80-character
        queue name limit. To determine whether a queue is FIFO, you can check whether the queue name ends with the
        suffix.

        If you have an existing application that uses standard queues and you want to take advantage of the ordering or
        exactly-once processing features of FIFO queues, you need to configure the queue and your application correctly.
        You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. To make the move, you must either create a new
        FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue.
