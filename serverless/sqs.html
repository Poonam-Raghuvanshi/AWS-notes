    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</p>

    <p> Fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems,
        and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating
        message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send,
        store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring
        other services to be available. SQS offers two types of message queues.

    <p class="heading"> Standard Queue</p>
    <p>
        Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and <b>at-least-once delivery </b>.
    </p>
    <p class="heading"> FIFO Queue</p>
    <p> <b>Messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent</b>.</p>
    <p> <b>By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 msg/sec with batching, or up to 300 msg/sec without batching
        </b>. The 3000 msg represents 300 msg in batch of 10 msg</p>
    <p><b> The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. </b> The suffix counts towards the 80-character
        queue name limit. </p>
    <p>
        Cannot convert an existing standard into FIFO queue. <b>You must either create
            a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO
            queue</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Amazon SQS temporary queues - Temporary queues help you save development time and deployment costs when using
        common message patterns such as request-response. You can use the Temporary Queue Client to create
        high-throughput, cost-effective, application-managed temporary queues.
        The client maps multiple temporary queues—application-managed queues created on demand for a particular
        process—onto a single Amazon SQS queue automatically. This allows your application to make fewer API calls and
        have a higher throughput when the traffic to each temporary queue is low. When a temporary queue is no longer in
        use, the client cleans up the temporary queue automatically, even if some processes that use the client aren't
        shut down cleanly.
        The following are the benefits of temporary queues:
        1. They serve as lightweight communication channels for specific threads or processes.
        2. They can be created and deleted without incurring additional costs.
        3. They are API-compatible with static (normal) Amazon SQS queues. This means that existing code that sends and
        receives messages can send messages to and receive messages from virtual queues.
        To better support short-lived, lightweight messaging destinations, AWS recommends Amazon SQS Temporary Queue
        Client. This client makes it easy to create and delete many temporary messaging destinations without inflating
        your AWS bill. The key concept behind the client is the virtual queue. Virtual queues let you multiplex many
        low-traffic queues onto a single SQS queue. Creating a virtual queue only instantiates a local buffer to hold
        messages for consumers as they arrive; there is no API call to SQS and no costs associated with creating a
        virtual queue.
        End-to-end process for sending messages through virtual queues:
      
        Amazon SQS dead-letter queues - Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues, which other queues (source queues) can
        target for messages that can't be processed (consumed) successfully. Dead-letter queues are useful for debugging
        your application or messaging system because they let you isolate problematic messages to determine why their
        processing doesn't succeed. Amazon SQS does not create the dead-letter queue automatically. You must first
        create the queue before using it as a dead-letter queue.
        Amazon SQS FIFO queues - FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications
        when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated. FIFO queues also
        provide exactly-once processing but have a limited number of transactions per second (TPS).
        Amazon SQS delay queues - Delay queues let you postpone the delivery of new messages to a queue for a number of
        seconds, for example, when your consumer application needs additional time to process messages. If you create a
        delay queue, any messages that you send to the queue remain invisible to consumers for the duration of the delay
        period. The default (minimum) delay for a queue is 0 seconds. The maximum is 15 minutes.
