    <p class="main-heading"> Amazon API Gateway</p>
    <p>
        Fully managed service that allows you to publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at
        any scale. Amazon API Gateway offers two options to create RESTful APIs, HTTP APIs and REST APIs, as well as an
        option to create WebSocket APIs.
    </p>
    <p>Amazon API Gateway <b> throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm </b>, where a token counts
        for a
        request. Specifically, API Gateway sets a limit on a steady-state rate and a burst of request submissions
        against all APIs in your account. In the token bucket algorithm, the burst is the maximum bucket size.</p>
    <p>API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that:
        Are HTTP-based.
        Enable stateless client-server communication.
        Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
        API Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that:
        Adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server.
        Route incoming messages based on message content.
