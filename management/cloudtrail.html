    <p>
        Enables <b>governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your
            AWS account</b>. </p>
    <p>With CloudTrail, you can log, continuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions
        across your AWS infrastructure.</p>
    <p> CloudTrail provides <b>event history of your AWS account activity </b>, including
        actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services.
        In general, to analyze any API calls made within an AWS account, CloudTrail is used.
    </p>
    <p>AWS recommends to turn on CloudTrail to log all IAM actions for monitoring and audit purposes.</p>
