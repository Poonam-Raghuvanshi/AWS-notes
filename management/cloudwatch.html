        <b> Monitoring and observability service </b> built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers
        (SREs), and IT managers. CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications,
        respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational
        health. Amazon CloudWatch allows you to monitor AWS cloud resources and the applications you run on AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use CloudWatch Alarms to send an email via SNS whenever any of the EC2 instances breaches a certain
        threshold.

            <p><strong>Correct Answer: B</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Option A is incorrect.</strong> CloudWatch access logging captures which resource accessed
                    an API and the method used to access the API. It is not used for execution traces, such as capturing
                    request and response payloads.</li>
                <li><strong>Option B is correct. </strong>CloudWatch execution logging allows you to capture user
                    request and response payloads as well as error traces.</li>
                <li><strong>Option C is incorrect.</strong> CloudTrail captures actions by users, roles, and AWS
                    services. CloudTrail records all AWS account activity. CloudTrail does not capture error traces.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Option D is incorrect. </strong>CloudTrail does not have a feature called execution logging.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Create Alarms That Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an Instance&nbsp;</strong><br>
            <br>
            Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or
            recover your instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions to&nbsp;save money when you no longer need
            an instance. You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover
            them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs.
        </p>

        <p>There are several scenarios in which you might want to stop or terminate your instance automatically. For
            example, you might have instances dedicated to batch payroll processing jobs or scientific computing tasks
            that run for a period of time and then complete their work. Rather than letting those instances sit idle
            (and accrue charges), you can stop or terminate them, helping you to save money. The main difference between
            using the stop and the terminate alarm actions is that you can easily restart a stopped instance if you need
            to rerun it later, and you can keep the same instance ID and root volume. However, you cannot restart a
            terminated instance. Instead, you must launch a new instance.</p>

        <p><br>
            You can add the stop, terminate, reboot, or recover actions to any alarm that is set on an Amazon EC2
            per-instance metric, including basic and detailed monitoring metrics provided by Amazon CloudWatch (in the
            AWS/EC2 namespace), as well as any custom metrics that include the InstanceId dimension, as long as its
            value refers to a valid running Amazon EC2 instance.</p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>Breakdown</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Option A is incorrect&nbsp;because CloudWatch Logs is not suitable to monitor the CloudWatch Metrics.
            </li>
            <li>Option B is correct.&nbsp;CloudWatch alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric. Alarms can
                trigger auto-scaling, EC2 actions(stop, terminate, recover, or reboot) and SNS notifications.</li>
            <li>Option C is incorrect because SQS cannot modify the EC2 state when a CloudWatch metric breaches a
                threshold value.</li>
            <li>Option D is incorrect because AWS Lambda is not necessary in this scenario. CloudWatch Alarms can
                directly monitor the metric and trigger actions when needed.</li>
        </ul>
