    <p class="main-heading"> AWS Organizations</p>

    <p>
        Yyou can consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. You
        can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. You can organize those
        accounts and manage them as a group. With AWS Account Management you can update the alternate contact
        information for each of your AWS accounts.

    </p>

    <p class="heading"> Service control policies (SCPs)</p>
    <p>
        <b>Organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. </b>SCPs offer central
        control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your
        organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines.
        SCPs are available only in an organization that has all features enabled. SCPs aren't available if your
        organization has enabled only the consolidated billing features. For instructions on enabling SCPs, see Enabling
        and disabling policy types.

        SCPs alone are not sufficient to granting permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are
        granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, on the actions that the account's administrator
        can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts. The administrator must still attach
        identity-based or resource-based policies to IAM users or roles, or to the resources in your accounts to
        actually grant permissions. The effective permissions are the logical intersection between what is allowed by
        the SCP and what is allowed by the IAM and resource-based policies.


    </p>
    <p>SCPs affect only member accounts in the organization. They have no effect on users or roles in the management
        account.</p>
    <p>If a user or role has an IAM permission policy that grants access to an action that is either not allowed or
        explicitly denied by the applicable SCPs, the user or role can't perform that action.</p>
