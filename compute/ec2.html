        <p class="heading">Amazon Machine Image (AMI) </p>
        <p>
            Template that contains a software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server,
            and applications). From an AMI, you launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual
            server in the cloud. You can launch multiple instances of an AMI, as shown in thefollowing figure.

        <p class="heading">Instances </p>
        <p>
            An instance is a virtual server in the cloud. Its configuration at launch is a copy of the AMI that you
            specified when you launched the instance.

            You can launch different types of instances from a single AMI. An instance type essentially determines the
            hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute and memory
            capabilities. Select an instance type based on the amount of memory and computing power that you need for
            the application or software that you plan to run on the instance. For more information, see Amazon EC2
            Instance Types.

            After you launch an instance, it looks like a traditional host, and you can interact with it as you would
            any computer. You have complete control of your instances; you can use sudo to run commands that require
            root privileges.

    <p class="heading">Placement Group </p>
    <p>
        When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of
        your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use placement
        groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload.
        Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement
        strategies:

    <p class="point"> Cluster placement group </p>
    <p>packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the
        low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC
        applications</p>

    <p class="point"> Partition placement group</p>
    <p>
        Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the
        underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large
        distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. <br /> A partition placement group
        can have a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone.
    </p>

    <p class="point"> Spread placement group.</p>

    Group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with each rack having
    its own network and power source. <br />

    Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that
    should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of
    simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks.

    A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a maximum of
    seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.
    </p>
    <p><b> Rack spread placement group </b>can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a
        maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</p>
    <p><b>Host spread level placement groups </b> are only available with AWS Outposts. For host spread level placement
        groups, there are no restrictions for running instances per Outposts.</p>
    <p class="heading"> EC2 Instance Types</p>
    <p class="point"> EC2 dedicated hosts</p>
    <p>
        Amazon EC2 instances on <b>physical servers that are dedicated for your use</b>.Dedicated Hosts give you
        additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server,and you can reliably use
        the same physical server over time. <b> Let you use your existing server-bound software licenses </b> and
        address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.
    </p>
    <p class="point"> EC2 dedicated instances</p>
    <p>
        <b>Amazon EC2 instances that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer</b>. Your dedicated
        instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts.
        Dedicated instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated
        instances.

    </p>
    <p class="point">On-Demand Instances</p>
    <p>
        <b> Pay, by the second, for the instances that you launch.</b>
    </p>
    <p class="point"> EC2 reserved instances</p>
    <p>
        Reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent instance configuration,
        including instance type and Region, for a term of 1 or 3 years.

    </p>
    <p class="point"> Launch template and launch configuration</p>
    <p>Similar but Launch template specifies instance <b> configuration information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine
            Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch
            EC2 instances</b>. Also, a launch template <b>allows you to have multiple versions of a template</b> and
        <b>Provision capacity across multiple instance types </b>using both On-Demand
        Instances and Spot Instances to achieve the desired scale, performance, and cost.
