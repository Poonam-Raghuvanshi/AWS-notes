        <p>
            Template that contains a software configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server,
            and applications). From an AMI, you launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual
            server in the cloud. You can launch multiple instances of an AMI, as shown in thefollowing figure.

        <p class="heading">Instances </p>
        <p>
            Virtual server in the cloud. Its configuration at launch is a copy of the AMI that you
            specified when you launched the instance.

            You can launch different types of instances from a single AMI. An instance type essentially determines the
            hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute and memory
            capabilities.
            You have complete control of your instances; you can use sudo to run commands that require
            root privileges. <br> <b>Per second billing continues - one-minute minimum charge.</b>

        </p>

    </section>
    <p class="heading">Instance Reboot </p>
    <p>The instance remains on the same host computer and maintains its public DNS name, private IP address, and any
        data on its instance store volumes. </p>

    <p class="heading">Instance Hibernate </p>
    <p>Your instance retains its private IPv4 address, which means that an Elastic IP address associated with the
        private IPv4 address or network interface is still associated with your instance. If your instance has an IPv6
        address, it retains its IPv6 address.</p>

    <p class="heading">Placement Group </p>
    <p>
        When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of
        your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use placement
        groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload.
        Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement
        strategies:

    <p class="point"> Cluster placement group </p>
    <p>packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the
        low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC
        applications</p>

    <p class="point"> Partition placement group</p>
    <p>
        Spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the
        underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large
        distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. <br /> A partition placement group
        can have a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone.
    </p>

    <p class="point"> Spread placement group.</p>

    Group of instances that are each placed on distinct racks, with each rack having
    its own network and power source. <br />

    Spread placement groups are recommended for applications that have a small number of critical instances that
    should be kept separate from each other. Launching instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of
    simultaneous failures that might occur when instances share the same racks.

    A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a maximum of
    seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.
    </p>
    <p><b> Rack spread placement group </b>can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. You can have a
        maximum of seven running instances per Availability Zone per group.</p>
    <p><b>Host spread level placement groups </b> are only available with AWS Outposts. For host spread level placement
        groups, there are no restrictions for running instances per Outposts.</p>
    <p class="heading"> EC2 Instance Types</p>
    <p><span class="point"> EC2 dedicated hosts</span>

        - <b>physical servers that are dedicated for your use</b>.Dedicated Hosts give you
        additional visibility and control over how instances are placed on a physical server,and you can reliably use
        the same physical server over time. <b> Let you use your existing server-bound software licenses </b> and
        address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.
    </p>
    <p> <span class="point"> EC2 dedicated instances</span>

        - <b>Instances that run in a VPC on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer</b>. Your dedicated
        instances are physically isolated at the host hardware level from instances that belong to other AWS accounts.
        Dedicated instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated
        instances.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="point"> On-Demand Instances</span> -
        <b> Pay, by the second, for the instances that you launch.</b>
    </p>

    <p><span class="point"> EC2 reserved instances</span> -
        Reduce your Amazon EC2 costs by making a commitment to a consistent instance configuration,
        including instance type and Region, for a term of 1 or 3 years.

    </p>
    <p> <span class="point"> Spot Instances</span> - Unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand
        price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can lower your
        Amazon EC2 costs significantly. <b>Spot Instances are a cost-effective choice if you can be flexible about when
            your applications run and if your applications can be interrupted </b>.</p>
    <p class="heading"> Launch template and launch configuration</p>
    <p>Similar but Launch template specifies instance <b> configuration information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine
            Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch
            EC2 instances</b>. Also, a launch template <b>allows you to have multiple versions of a template</b> and
        <b>Provision capacity across multiple instance types </b>using both On-Demand
        Instances and Spot Instances to achieve the desired scale, performance, and cost.
    </p>
    <p class="heading">User data </p>
    <p>Perform common automated configuration tasks and even run scripts after the instance starts. When you launch an
        instance in Amazon EC2, you can pass two types of user data - shell scripts
        and cloud-init directives. You can also pass this data into the launch wizard as plain text or as a file.</p>
    <p>Scripts entered as user data are executed as the root user, hence do not need the sudo command in the script. Any
        files you create will be owned by root; if you need non-root users to have file access, you should modify the
        permissions accordingly in the script.</p>
    <p> <b>Run when you first launch an instance</b>- You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data
        scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.</p>
    <p class="heading">Request throttling for the Amazon EC2 API - </p>
    <p> If you exceed an API throttling limit, you get the RequestLimitExceeded error code. You can use Amazon
        CloudWatch to monitor your Amazon EC2 API calls and to collect and track metrics around API throttling. </p>
    <p><b>When the new AMI is copied from region A into region B, it automatically creates a snapshot in region B
            because
            AMIs are based on the underlying snapshots.</b></p>
    <p class="heading">EC2 Instance store </p>
    <p> <b>The data in an instance store persists only during the lifetime of its associated instance.</b>This storage
        is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for
        the temporary block-level storage of information that changes frequently such as buffers, caches, scratch data,
        and other temporary content, or for data that is
        replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. <b> Instance store volumes
            are included as part of the instance's usage cost. </b>
        As Instance Store based volumes provide high random I/O performance at low cost (as the storage is part of the
        instance's usage cost) and the resilient architecture can adjust for the loss of any instance,
    </p>
    <p class="heading">Default termination policy </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        
            Determine whether any of the instances use the oldest launch template, unless there are instances that use a
            launch configuration. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling terminates instances that use a launch configuration before it
            terminates instances that use a launch template.</li>

        <li> After applying the preceding criteria, if there are multiple unprotected instances to terminate, determine
            which instances are closest to the next billing hour. If there are multiple unprotected instances closest to
            the next billing hour, terminate one of these instances at random. </li>
    </ul>
