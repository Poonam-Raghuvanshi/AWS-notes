    <p>
        Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike
        speech, allowing you to create applications that talk and build entirely new categories
        of speech-enabled products. So, Krish can easily use Amazon Polly to build the required
        feature in the platform without any hassle.

        <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> <strong>A</strong></p>

        <p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Anywhere is a feature of Amazon ECS that enables you to run and manage
            container workloads on customer-managed infrastructure efficiently.<br>
            ECS Anywhere builds upon the ease and simplicity of Amazon ECS to provide a consistent tooling and API
            experience across your container-based applications.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A is CORRECT </strong>because you need AWS Systems Manager to supply a secret activation
                code that allows the agent to register itself with AWS Systems Manager as a managed instance, which is
                necessary to run your instances on ECS Anywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, it is necessary for the Amazon ECS agent to have connectivity with your ECS Cluster.<br>
            Docker is used if you want to run container workloads on-prem.<br>
            And you can apply the following command on your Linux instance to register to the Amazon ECS:</p>

        <p>curl --proto "https" -o "/tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh"
            "https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install-latest.sh" &amp;&amp; bash
            /tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh --region "YourRegion" --cluster "Cluster-name" --activation-id
            "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxx" --activation-code "xxxxxxxxx"</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Option B is incorrect </strong>because Amazon ECS agents must also be included, if not, the
                servers canâ€™t be registered on the ECS cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Option C is incorrect </strong>because Amazon Systems Manager Agent must also be included, if
                not, the servers will not be registered as managed instances and will not complete the registration of
                the servers into the ECS Cluster.</li>
            <li><strong>Option D is incorrect </strong>as we are missing the Amazon Systems Manager Agent. Amazon
                CloudWatch&nbsp; agent would provide the possibility to forward logs to Amazon CloudWatch , but the
                servers will not be able to register.</li>
        </ul>
