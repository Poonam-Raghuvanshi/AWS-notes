        identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, etc. and also
        provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial search capabilities that you can use
        to detect, analyze, and compare faces for various use cases. It can’t do the Text to

        References:
        service that automatically extracts printed text, handwriting, and other data from
        scanned documents. It is for the use cases that go beyond simple optical character
        recognition (OCR) to identify, understand, and extract data from forms and tables. It
        can’t do the Text to Speech Conversion.
        Option C is incorrect because Amazon Comprehend is a natural-language processing
        (NLP) service that uses machine learning to uncover valuable insights and connections
        in text. It is used mainly for sentiment analysis from the given text, but not for text-tospeech conversions.
        Option D is CORRECT because Amazon Polly is a service that turns text into lifelike
        speech, allowing you to create applications that talk and build entirely new categories
        of speech-enabled products. So, Krish can easily use Amazon Polly to build the required
        feature in the platform without any hassle.
